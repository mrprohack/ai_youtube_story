# Mindset and Wealth Creation
Duration: 4 minutes

The book highlights the importance of having a wealth-creating mindset. Kiyosaki argues that most people are conditioned to be employees, rather than entrepreneurs, and that this mindset holds them back from achieving financial freedom. He encourages readers to think differently about money and to focus on building wealth, rather than just earning a salary.
